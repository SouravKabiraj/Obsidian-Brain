## Situation:
Earlier in my career, we were maintaining separate monitoring dashboards for each of our services.
This meant every time a new service was added or an existing service was updated, we had to manually adjust and update all dashboards.
This process was time-consuming and required significant development effort, which drained valuable resources.

## Task:
My goal was to streamline the process and reduce the development bandwidth spent on maintaining multiple dashboards,
making the system more scalable and efficient.

## Action:
I took the initiative to consolidate all the service dashboards into a single, unified Grafana dashboard.
I leveraged the service name as a parameter, so the same dashboard could be used for any service.
This meant that instead of maintaining multiple dashboards,
we could simply update one, and it would automatically apply to all services by changing the service name in the parameter.

## Result:
This change significantly reduced the development effort required to manage dashboards.
It also saved us a considerable amount of time and resources,
allowing the team to focus more on enhancing the dashboard itself and working on higher-priority tasks.
As a result, we were able to scale our monitoring system more efficiently without increasing overhead.
