Hi, I'm Sourav Kabiraj, currently working as the Lead Backend Engineer at Grab Digibank.

I’m leading the development of our retail lending platform,
overseeing the design and implementation of end-to-end backend solutions for core lending operations.
My team and I focus on building scalable, reliable systems that ensure a seamless user experience.

Apart from coding, I’m involved in system design, reviewing architecture, and optimizing backend workflows for performance.
I also mentor junior and mid-level developers, help with sprint planning and task estimation, and represent my team in cross-functional collaborations.

In addition to these, I handle critical production issues, debugging, and minimizing downtime, while also implementing robust logging and monitoring systems.
I take ownership of security and compliance for our lending systems, ensuring they meet all regulatory standards.
