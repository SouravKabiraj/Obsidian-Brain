## Situation:
In my current role as a team lead at Grab,
I often work with cross-functional teams and need to gather requirements,
understand problem statements, and align on solutions.

## Task:
One of my challenges is that when someone is explaining a problem or requirement,
I tend to subconsciously start designing the solution in my mind as I listen.
While this helps me quickly conceptualize solutions,
it sometimes leads me to miss some of the finer details or nuances of the problem that are being discussed.

## Action:
To mitigate this, I’ve been working on improving my active listening skills.
I now make a conscious effort to fully understand the problem before jumping to potential solutions.
I also take notes more frequently to ensure I capture key points.
I’ve also been scheduling follow-up discussions to clarify any points I might have missed during the initial conversation.

## Result:
By making these adjustments, I’ve become better at absorbing all aspects of the problem,
and I’ve found that my solutions are more aligned with the actual requirements.
This has also improved communication within my team, as I’m able to ask more targeted questions and ensure that everyone’s concerns are addressed from the start.
