# Survival Guide
## The importance of letting go
Stop coding!! My goal is to keep larger team productive, collective result, make sure they are working on right things
```
"Amplify the team, don't amplify your"
```
## Don't steal credit
Guide team to their right direction, but ultimately it is their achievement.
## Leading By Example
Engineers ofter copy their manager/lead. Try to be their role model.
Be Honest
Be Focus on result
Be Positive
Be Happy, if you are not happy, team will pick that up
## Time Management
Manage Email Inbox like ![[diagram_1.canvas]]
Manage Slack Inbox like ![[diagram_2.canvas]]
Create a TODO list
Block calendar to do any task
## Remain Focused
Block calendar to do any task
Put of headphone
Put a **"Busy"** slack status
Stop Notification 
## Delegation
Share task according of the teammate's career plan
While sharing the task share the following details as well 
1) Requirements
2) When it is need to be done by
3) How to get more information
4) What will be following meeting 
5) Open communication channel to get details for delay *(if any)*

### Common pitfall 
Do not take any task just because you don't trust anyone else!!!
#### Delegating out 
Scope out task if project/team/product goal is not aligned
If possible, assign it to project manager

## Think Strategically, Act Tactically 
### Strategically 
Ask the following questions
1) What is objective?
2) Why we are building?
3) What will be customer experience?
4) Why we are building something?
### Tactics
1) How you are going to do it?
2) Who will work on it?
3) How you are going to achieve them?

# Delivering Result from a Team
## Avoid Overcommitment
1) Don't give accurate estimate, consider overhead like meeting, etc
2) Include Project Manager when someone ask you for estimation
3) Actual ETA = Estimate Time x 3

### Tactics: How things get done
1) Break down whole project into multiple sub project
2) Break down sub projects into multiple tasks
3) Break down tasks into multiple sub tasks
4) Create a dependency graph for all the sub tasks
5) Create project milestones
6) Understand **External dependencies**
7) Understand team's availability
8) Understand team's efficiency
9) Use **Kanban** for project status
10) Open letter to share project status

### Pushing things forward
1) Use **Kanban** for project status
2) Share weekly **1:1** with project mates
   1) Ask if there is any blocker?
   2) What are you doing right now?
   3) How you spend this week?
   4) What distraction / What all meeting you attended?

## Situational Awareness
Check Project manager frequently
- Current Status
- Current Blocker 
- Any Delay
### How to deal with delay in project
Find if there is any blocker
Understand the blocker 
Help teammates to resolve the blocker

## Importance of Simplicity
Number of task is to get things done
Understand the result to be delivered
**Simplicity = Less things to break + quick delivery + lower cost**

## Working Backwards
Working backward from the "customer experience" you want to deliver, and figure out the simplest technical solution to deliver the experience.
```
Customer Experience -> Simplest Solution
```

[DON'T] Give solution in search for a problem
[DO] Give solution which meet the target and simple

```
Steps:
1) Start with the UI and UX
2) Then the service that powers the UI
3) Then the data that powers the service
```
